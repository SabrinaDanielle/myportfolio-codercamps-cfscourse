            <div class="me">
            <p>I am a classically trained singer, and a Gullah Geechee native of Beaufort, S.C. While music is my first love and will always remain a passion of mine, I am just as crazy about technology and helping others. I like working with others to manifest their ideas to make them a reality. I enjoy every step of project development, from inspiration to creation, to maturation and conservation.</p>
  
        
          <h2>My Background</h2>
           <p>Although I graduated from Converse College with a BM in Music Vocal Performance; I have taken several technologies centered courses. I have learned digital literacy skills by trade and independent study, and have recently begun transitioning from being a middle school teacher to becoming a full-time developer. </p>

          <h2>Why I decided to Learn Programming</h2>
          <p>I went from being the sound/stage technician for a music school to being an analyst for a financial institution, to a music technology trailblazer in the classroom. Technology is everywhere. Technology is magical. I decided to learn programming skills because I want to create and learn the inner workings of said magic. When given the opportunity to create beautiful solutions to multifaceted problems—I thrive. Becoming a developer doesn’t just mean I will be waking every day to a career I love. I have been enamored with computers since grade school; however, I did not have the resources to pursue being successful in tech.  I desire to become a successful programmer to help our youth in underprivileged communities, realize and achieve their tech dreams. Also, as a woman and a minority…It is my goal to be of service in the tech field by doing my part to diversify the tech force. We are all surrounded by the magic of technology. Tech is indefinitely expansive. Tech is becoming more engrained in our everyday lives…diverse tech problems, call for diverse tech solvers…</p>
